# Nintendo Parent Control Reset

This app was created using React and Typescript. You can find the live project [here](https://parental.dereffi.com/).

The code behind this app is based on a python script from Hector Martin Cantero. You can find it in the template folder or [here](https://wii.marcan.st/parental).

## Support

At the moment you can only reset the parent control of the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DSI with the 8-digit control code.
Feel free to contribute code for other devices.

- `npm install` to install the necessary node modules
- `npm run start` to start a local dev server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder
